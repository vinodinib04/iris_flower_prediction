# Iris Flower Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the species of the Iris flower based on various features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for beginners in machine learning.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica using supervised learning techniques. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)

Each sample belongs to one of three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica
